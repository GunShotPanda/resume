# resume

一个基于 Vue 的个人主页，包含个人经历展示、资质证书展示，还可以分享自己看过的小说、看过的电影……

非常抱歉项目初始只是想要部署在自己的服务器上做主页展示，所以有些内容是硬编码的，并且是前后端分离的模式。目前有打算进行改造，以便其他人可以开箱即用，也欢迎您贡献代码并 Pull Requests。

无论如何，对于想要熟悉前后端交互、前后端分离、前端设计、Vue 的用户，这是一个不错的仓库。

A personal homepage based on Vue, including personal experience display, qualification certificate display, also you can share your own read novels, watched movies...

Sorry that the project initially was just designed to be deployed on my own server for the home page presentation, so some of the content of my personal information is hard-coded and is in a front-back stage decoupling mode. There are plans to refactor it so others can use it in an easier way, and you are welcome to contribute code and Pull Requests.

In any case, this is a good repository for those who want to be familiar with front-end interactions, front-end decoupling, front-end design, and Vue.js.
